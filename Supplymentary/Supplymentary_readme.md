## Supplementary materials

Here, we provide a detailed proof of Theorem 1. We also show a thorough description of the experimental setup and additional experimental results.

## New Benchmark: ZERO

The results include a new benchmark, ZERO, which employs substitute model updates with zero per round as a compensation. This approach differs from the benchmark dropout method and demonstrates that substitute model updates with zero lead to worse results. The result is shown in zero.png. 
The results of ZERO was not included in the supplementary materials as it was significantly inferior compared to the other benchmarks.
