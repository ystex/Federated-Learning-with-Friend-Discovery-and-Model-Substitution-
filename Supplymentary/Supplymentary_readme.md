## Zero.png

The results include a new benchmark, ZERO, which employs substitute model updates with zero per round as a compensation. This approach differs from the benchmark dropout method and demonstrates that substitute model updates with zero lead to worse results.


## Supplementary materials

Here, we provide a detailed proof of Theorem 1. We also show a thorough description of the experimental setup and additional experimental results.
